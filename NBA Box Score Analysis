# I downloaded an NBA Box Score Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukedip/nba-boxscore-dataset
# I uploaded the database to SQLite.
# I then used SQL to analyze this data and answer specific questions about it.

# Did teams win more when home or away between 2013 and 2015?
SELECT count(result) as 'Total',
sum(case when result = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as 'Home',
sum(case when result = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as 'Away' 
FROM NBA.game_info 
WHERE date BETWEEN '2013%' AND '2015%';

# Did the trend continue between 2016 and 2018?
SELECT count(result) as 'Total',
sum(case when result = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as 'Home',
sum(case when result = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as 'Away' 
FROM NBA.game_info 
WHERE date BETWEEN '2016%' AND '2018%';

# Who had the best FG% in 2015 and what team did they play for?
SELECT ps.player, MAX(ps.FGp) as FieldGoalPercentage, ps.team
FROM player_stats ps
LEFT JOIN game_info gi
ON gi.game_id = ps.game_id
WHERE gi.season = 1415
ORDER BY ps.FGp DESC
