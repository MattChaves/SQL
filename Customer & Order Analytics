--In this SQL, I'm answering specific questions about the data from a specific database. Some of the data was a bit messy so that's taken into account when querying it.

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
