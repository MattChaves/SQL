# I downloaded a Spotify Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?resource=download
# I created a table to insert all of the Spotify data into.
# I then used SQL to analyze this data and answer specific questions about it.

#Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#I then inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data asking the following questions and answering them with SQL.

--What's the longest song in this dataset?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What's the loudest song in this dataset?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(loudness) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--How many songs does Lil Nas X have in this dataset?
SELECT count(artist_name) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name = 'Lil Nas X';

--What are 5 songs that are going to get me pumped up?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY energy DESC 
LIMIT 5;

--Who are the top 5 artists whose songs are perfect for a dance party?
SELECT artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 5;

--What's the average danceability, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness for each artist?
SELECT distinct artist_name, avg(danceability), avg(loudness), avg(speechiness), avg(acousticness), avg(instrumentalness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name;
